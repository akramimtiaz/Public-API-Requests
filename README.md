# techdegree-project-5

This project involves an app for a fictional company called Awesome Startup, a distributed company with remote employees working all over the world. They need a smart way for employees to share contact information with each other.

It employs the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to grab information for 12 random “employees,” and use that data to build a prototype for an Awesome Startup employee directory.

This project aims to showcase competency in using public APIs, making API requests, and asynchronously handling the data that will be returned from your requests and displayed in an app.
